**This is a docker image for running [Gremlins](https://github.com/marmelab/gremlins.js) from docker container with help of playwright to navigate to a specific web page, perform authentication and collect logs from browser.**

The [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) was design based on the following projects:
- [Playwright](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-playwright)

# How to use Gremlins on docker container image:
1. Clone this repo
2. Open "playwright/gremlins.js" file in a preferred text editor or IDE
3. Change "baseUrl" variable with your application's URL
4. (Optional) Add authentification steps if your application requires it under "//Add any navigation or login steps bellow" comment
5. Navigate to the cloned repo in your local machine with CMD/bash
6. Run *docker-compose build gremlins-on-docker*
7. Run *docker-compose up* (**Note** current restart policy is unless-stopped, so don't forget to stop container or change restart policy)

# gremlins.js settings you should know about:
- You can capture screenshots at the end of execution by changing false -> true for "takeScreenshotAtTheEnd"
